- Select the theme from the **View** > **Theme** menu  

## Credits ##

The Tubster theme is not my creation, but I couldn't find a tmBundle out there, so I made it myself. I couldn't trace the author, but feel free to contact me if you're the author or you know him.

The Tubsted variation is a creation of @eduardolundgren.
